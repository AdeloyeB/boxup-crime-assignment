    title: Social Youth Organisation
    description: >
      We are a social youth organisation operating out of the London borough Barking and Dagenham. We work with young people at risk of having their lives ruined by crime and motivate them to rebuild and recapture their dreams and aspirations. We believe that every young person is entitled to a bright future, inspired by their hopes and dreams, regardless of their background. We are passionate about getting 1000s of young people out of gangs each year .

    title: Our Future
    description: >
      We have been taking part in a number of initiatives outside of the UK. For example, we visited Ghana last year and are delighted that another community was able to benefit from the Box Up Crime Experience. We have also been able to expand to Switzerland and are looking to set up a gym there full time within the next few months.
