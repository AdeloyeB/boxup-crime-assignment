This is createPathway assignment. Our brief is to create a website for Prospex using a CMS system like Hugo or Jekyll.

# Task 1: Basic Requirements (60%)

### 1.1 Technical Criteria: (40%)

#### The website should:

- [ ] Be marked up using semantic HTML5 elements including main, section, nav and article
- [ ] Be fully accessible including aria-labels, tab index, title, alt and role attributes
- [ ] Use a CSS framework such as Bootstrap or Tachyons for visual layout

- [ ] Have a consistent approach to typography
- [ ] Use colours that meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
- [ ] Be responsive
- [ ] Work in multiple browsers

### Client Criteria: 20%

- [ ] The website should communicate what the organisation is, what it does, and
      showcase its programmes.

# Task 2: Advanced Requirements (40%)

### 2.1 Technical Criteria: (15%)

- [ ] Pages and posts are editable by the client using a content management system.
- [ ] Deploys automatically on a push to the master branch.

### 2.2 Client Criteria: (25%)

- [ ] The website should closely meet the client requirements laid out in the notes and
      documents contained in the project folder. These requirements are not clear, and
      you need to use your judgement as the designer to help the client communicate
      effectively online.
